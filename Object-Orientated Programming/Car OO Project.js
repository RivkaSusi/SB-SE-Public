/* PART ONE
Create a class for vehicle. Each vehicle instance should have the following properties:

- make
- model
- year

Each vehicle instance should have access to a method called ***honk***, which returns the string “Beep.”
Each vehicle instance should have a method called toString, which returns the string containing the make, model and year.
*/
class Vehicle {
    constructor(make, model, year){
        this.make = make; 
        this.model = model;

    }
    toString(){
        return "This vehicle is a ${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}'.";
    }
}
/* PART TWO
Create a class for a car. The Car class should inherit from Vehicle and each car instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 4.
*/
class Car extends Vehicle {
    constructor(make, model, year){
        super(make, model, year);
        this.numWheels = 4;
    }
}
/* PART THREE
Create a class for a Motorcycle. This class should inherit from Vehicle and each motorcycle instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 2. It should also have a revEngine method which returns “VROOM!!!”
*/
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    constructor(make, model, year){
        super(make, model, year);
        this.numWheels = 2;
    }
    revEngine(){
        return "VROOM!!!";
    }
}
/* PART FOUR
Create a class for a Garage. It should have a property called ***vehicles*** which will store an array of vehicles, and a property called ***capacity*** which is a number indicating how many vehicles will fit in the garage. When you create a garage, ***vehicles*** will always be empty; you only need to provide the ***capacity***.

A garage should also have an ***add*** method, which attempts to add a vehicle to the array of vehicles. However, if you try to add something which is *not* a vehicle, the garage should return the message “Only vehicles are allowed in here!”. Also, if the garage is at capacity, it should say “Sorry, we’re full.”
*/
class Garage {
    constructor(capacity){
        this.vehicles = [];
        this.capactiy = capacity;
    }
    add (newVehicle){
        if(!(newVehicle instanceof Vehicle)){
            return "Only vehicles are allowed in here!";
        }
        if(this.vehicles.length >= this.capacity){
            return "Sorry we're full.";
